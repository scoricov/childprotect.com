<p>File exchanging and cloud hosting services are interested in preventing the spread of child abuse files, but</p>
<ul>
    <li>they have to deal with terabytes of information</li>
    <li>they canâ€™t automatically evaluate files for abuse-content</li>
    <li>their branched architecture complicates the task</li>
</ul>
